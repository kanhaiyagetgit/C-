When u add constexpr before a function u actually make that function to be executed at compile time

When u say that destructor is an instance member function or an object is an instance of a class u mean
it works only for the object / occurence of a real world entity

Destructor can never be static
Constructor and destructor hv no return types and hence no function types
Destructor takes no arguments unlike Constructor which can take arguments
Since no parameters are passed to destructors overloading is not possible
Compiler automatic creates Constructor and destructor by default
Default destructor has an empty body
Destructor is the last fn which is called by an object before it is destroyed
Destructor is used to release resources allocated to an object.
